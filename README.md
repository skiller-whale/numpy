# Skiller Whale, Exercises for NumPy 

This repo includes exercises to accompany Skiller Whale sessions on NumPy 

During each session you'll be asked to write and edit code in some of the files. 

Make sure you have the `requests` and `numpy` python libraries installed. You could do that by running these two commands:
* `python3 -m ensurepip`
* `python3 -m pip install requests numpy`
    
The `sync.py` script is used to share your files with the person leading the session, so that they can see the code you're writing, and help out when needed.
